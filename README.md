# Bangalore-House-Price-Predictor
This project involves building a Machine Learning model to predict house prices in Bangalore using Python.

Utilized a Linear Regression model to predict prices based on key features such as locality, area, number of rooms, and bathrooms.

Applied One-hot encoding to effectively handle categorical variables like location, improving model interpretability.

Designed an end-to-end pipeline incorporating data imputation, feature engineering, outlier removal, and encoding.

Evaluated model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared, ensuring reliable and accurate predictions.

Focused on creating a scalable and data-driven solution for real estate price estimation.

This project demonstrates expertise in data preprocessing, regression modeling, and performance evaluation for real-world datasets.
